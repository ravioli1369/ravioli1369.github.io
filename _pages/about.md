Hulo, I'm Ravi! I am currently an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and I'm pursuing photography as a hobby. This website is meant to showcase my work over the years. The photographs are organised as best as possible by genre along with all the EXIF data.  A google photos album with all my pictures can be found [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPHr3acEVc29IClp3grcOXwL2Ck_wf1S76vEvRECqR21k8uzmjveAJxiceT_gFYdA?key=S3ViTUU4b19WTi1wTWR0YTFDd1lVMVVTdTJDenl3).
