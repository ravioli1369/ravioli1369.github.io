hulo, i'm ravi! i am currently an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and I'm pursuing photography as a hobby. this website is meant to showcase my work over the years. the photographs are organised as best as possible by genre along with all the EXIF data.  a google photos album with all my pictures can be found [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPHr3acEVc29IClp3grcOXwL2Ck_wf1S76vEvRECqR21k8uzmjveAJxiceT_gFYdA?key=S3ViTUU4b19WTi1wTWR0YTFDd1lVMVVTdTJDenl3).

i'm also interested in astrophotography and astronomy in general. my astrophotography can be found along with my other photos in the [astrophotography](/astrophotography) section. i also have research projects relating to astronomy and astrophysics which can be found in the [projects](/projects) section.
