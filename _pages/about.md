hulo, i'm ravi! i'm currently an undergrad at the indian institute of technology, bombay. this website is meant to showcase my work and interests over the years. my interests include photography, astronomy, astrophotography, and programming amongst other things. 

you can find some of my best photographs in the [photography](/photography) section, organised as best as possible by genre along with all the EXIF data. a google photos album containing all my pictures can be found [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPHr3acEVc29IClp3grcOXwL2Ck_wf1S76vEvRECqR21k8uzmjveAJxiceT_gFYdA?key=S3ViTUU4b19WTi1wTWR0YTFDd1lVMVVTdTJDenl3). i like to write about photography and the technical aspects of in the form of tutorials and can be found with the [#tutorial](/blog/tag/tutorial/) tag in the [projects](/blog) section.

my astrophotography can be found in the [astrophotography](/astrophotography) section, with details of equpiment used, integration time, etc. i've mainly been involved in computational astronomy research projects which can be found in the [projects](/blog) section.
