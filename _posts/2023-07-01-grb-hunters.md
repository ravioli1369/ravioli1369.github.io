[Gamma-Ray Bursts](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/bursts1.html) (GRBs) are fascinating astronomical phenomena that have
captured the attention of scientists and researchers around the world. These
powerful bursts of gamma-ray radiation, lasting from a fraction of a second to a
few minutes, provide valuable insights into the universeâ€™s workings.

The GRB Hunters project aims to create a method to detect grbs based on their signal-to-noise ratio 
in the data from the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) onboard ISRO's AstroSat. By statistically analysing the noise in the data, a quantitative measure of the signal-to-noise ratio was obtained. This was then used to distinguish particle/noise data from real sources of gamma rays.
